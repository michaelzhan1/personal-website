          <p className="mb-3">Hi! I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering at Harvard, and I graduated from UT Austin in Chemical Engineering with a certificate in Computer Science with high honors in 2023. I'm currently exploring the software engineering and web development space, and I've developed some personal projects along the way.</p>
          <p className="mb-3">Through high school and college, I treated coding more of as an interest; I completed the Computer Science certificate at UT Austin and casually went through problems from ProjectEuler and Leetcode. In my junior year of college, I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in software engineering. I gained experience through both industry internships and academic research projects, and I aim to continue learning and growing through my master's program.</p>
          <p className="mb-3">I recently started learning web development on my own, and I've developed a few side projects along the way (including this website). I come from a Python background with a bit of C++ splashed in, and have been gradually immersing myself into the JavaScript ecosystem. I started from static HTML/CSS/JS, then learned dynamic web development with Flask, and finally learned React and Next.js. I'm currently exploring Typescript and TailwindCSS.</p>
