          <p className="mb-3">Hi! I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering at Harvard, and I graduated from UT Austin in Chemical Engineering. I'm currently exploring the software engineering and web development space, and I've developed some personal projects along the way as a means to learn new things.</p>
          <p className="mb-3">Through high school and college, I treated coding more of as an interest; I completed the Computer Science certificate at UT Austin and casually went through problems from Project Euler and Leetcode. In my junior year of college, I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in software engineering. I gained experience through industry internships, academic research, and personal projects, and I aim to continue learning and growing through my master's program.</p>
          <p className="mb-3">My plan through the master's program has been to essentially take all of the standard CS courses that I didn't in my undergrad. So far, I've taken courses on data structures and algorithms, artificial intelligence, and systems development, and I'm currently taking courses on graph theory, computer graphics, high performance computing, and computer networking.</p>
          <p className="mb-5"> I've been learning web development on my own, and I've developed a few side projects along the way (including this website!). I come from a Python background with a bit of C++ splashed in, and have been gradually immersing myself into the JavaScript ecosystem. I started from static HTML/CSS/JS, then learned dynamic web development with Flask, and finally moved into React via Next.js. Since then, I've also started using TypeScript and TailwindCSS, as well as learning C++ at a more in-depth level on the side. I've recently discovered an interest in graphics as well, leading me to build my first graphics-based project in an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Some of my more prominent projects can be found on the Projects page, and all of my projects can be found on my GitHub, linked in the footer.</p>
